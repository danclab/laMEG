Vertex correspondence is maintained, i.e each layer will have vertices along the vector connecting a white matter surface vertex with the corresponding pial surface vertex. Each surface will then be converted to gifti format and the vertex coordinates will adjusted by the RAS at the center of the volume to put them in native space.\n",
